   Known ISSUES:
   -------------------------

(01) NEW MANAGE order overrides values of any CHANGE RELEASE order.

(02) It is not clear how to preserve history of order in case of (01) because of the 
     way how NEW MANAGE order is implemented: Delete old NEW RELEASE and create new
     NEW MANAGE. Thus, neither OrderSentDate nor CreateDate is preserved, and ordering
     of orders is lost.

(05) To keep optimal performance, CSI2 schema in the Oracle should be regularly analyzed.


   Here are some TODO items:
   -------------------------

(11) More tests, more tests, more tests... (ALL!!!)
     Test UpdateManager. Test Performance. Test Load.


(14) Question:
       Do we need verify that <Type/> has valid value for particular OrderType,
       OrderStatus, or just do nothing and ignore invalid values?
     Answer by Joseph:
       If you receive an invalid  value - send a message to the error queue -
       but accept the message anyway ignoring the erroneous service element.
     TODO: Write table of allowed combinations of OrderType / OrderStatus / <Type/>


(17) Ask equant why on Earth lupddate and createdate values are *not* created by CSI but taken
     from the incoming order
